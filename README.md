# PotterVerse

Harry Potter Character Network Visualization.
Exploring whether it exhibits the same properties as a real social network.

## Installation
This guide takes place in the Mac OSX Terminal.
```
cd ~/Sites/
git clone git@github.com:efekarakus/potter-network.git
```

Open up your browser and go to the URL:
```

```

## Datasets

All of the dataset can be found under the <i>data/</i> folder.
There are two important files:
* <i>characters.csv</i> which is a list of 65 Harry Potter characters that we decided to explore.
* <i>relations.csv</i> is a list of undirected relations between each character. The type denotes if the two characters are allies or enemies.

Note that most of the relations were checked with facts from the [Harry Potter Wikia](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page).

## Roles
